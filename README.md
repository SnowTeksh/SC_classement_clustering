a little project for a job interview

There are 5 files inside the main branch.

The last 2 .csv 'top_100_films' and 'top_200_films' are both training set. The 'sc_films' is the file containing the predictions for the project.

You can find 2 python files inside the main branch as well. The main one is called 'activite_conviviale', it's a jupyter Notebook that you can execute fully based on 2 conditions.
The first condition is to have the training set located where 'activite_conviviale' is also (obviously). The second one is to have the 'functions_ACP.py' in the same file also. You can find inside some function relative to an ACP analysis. Some of them are already in others packages, but it was a preference of myself to code them properly, you can open it and scroll to explore.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions to improve it.

Thanks

Victor B.
